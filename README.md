# ESWT-Ne: Image Inpainting Using Two-Stage Adversarial Networks with Efficient Stripe window Transformer

Image inpainting has been research and made significant advances in recent years. However, it is still challenging to recover the corrupted image with both visually reasonable structure and the continuity of adjacent textures. Some state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods only tackle the textures while losing holistic structures due to the limited receptive fields of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). On the other hand, attention-based models can notice the global information for the structures, but they need the heavy computation for inference. To address these issues, we propose to use a rectangle window transformer to facilitate structure of the image inpainting. The proposed model easily acquires long-range dependencies through a powerful attention-based Transformer model. For textures, we propose a new color loss to progressively inpainting the color. The average color of our recovered images can be closer to reality. At last, we in order to enhance the recover effect, we additionally design a self-attention based on CNN based attention sharing. Compared with other state-of-the art methods, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed model on various datasets.
